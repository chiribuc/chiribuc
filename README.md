# Web developer, father and, amateur bodybuilder.

Hello, I'm Robert-Cristian Chiribuc, a senior web developer based in Bucharest, Romania, with extensive experience in building medium to large scale web applications.

I specialize in PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, Vue.js, and React, and I'm passionate about creating high-quality, scalable, and maintainable code that meets the needs of clients and end-users alike.

When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym, where I pursue my passion for bodybuilding, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.
I'm also a husband and father of two lovely kids.
