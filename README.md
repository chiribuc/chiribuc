# Web developer, father and, amateur bodybuilder.

Greetings, I'm Robert-Cristian Chiribuc, a seasoned web developer based in Bucharest, Romania. With a wealth of experience, I excel in crafting medium to large scale web applications.

My expertise lies in PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, Vue.js, and React. I am deeply committed to producing top-notch, scalable, and maintainable code that caters to the diverse needs of clients and end-users.

Beyond coding, you'll often find me at the gym, passionately pursuing bodybuilding to strike a harmonious balance between work and life. I also take pride in being a dedicated husband and father to two wonderful kids.
